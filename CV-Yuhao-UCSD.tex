\section{\sc Research Interests and Impact}
My research centers on advancing ML systems and large-scale data analytics, focusing on both applied ML systems that power novel applications and ML-optimized systems that streamline data science workflows for efficiency and scalability. My past and ongoing projects span large-scale distributed AutoML, distributed in-database deep learning, scalable graph neural network training, and advanced video analytics and querying systems. All previous work has been released as open-source software. My research on Cerebro and Cerebro-DS has been incorporated into the Apache MADlib open-source project and integrated into VMwareâ€™s Greenplum Database, directly enhancing its capabilities for enterprise customers and enabling public health researchers at UCSD to train ML/AI models for understanding and preventing kidney and digestive diseases. Additionally, these projects are available as third-party tools for Databricks users, broadening access and impact across data science teams. My work has also inspired the creation of RapidFire AI, an AI startup that recently raised \$4M in seed funding based on my research contributions. Furthermore, my work on Lotan, a system for large-scale GNN training, has garnered interest from a prominent graph DBMS vendor, underscoring its relevance and impact within the industry.

\section{\sc Projects}
{\bf Lotan: Bridging the Gap between GNNs and Scalable Graph Analytics Engines:}

Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have changed the landscape of modern graph analytics. The complexity of GNN training and the challenges of GNN scalability has also sparked interest from the systems community, with efforts to build systems that provide higher efficiency and schemes to reduce costs. However, we observe that many such systems basically "reinvent the wheel" of much work done in the database world on scalable graph analytics engines. Further, they often tightly couple the scalability treatments of graph data processing with that of GNN training, resulting in entangled complex problems and systems that often do not scale well on one of those axes.

This paper asks a fundamental question: How far can we push existing systems for scalable graph analytics and deep learning (DL) instead of building custom GNN systems? Are compromises inevitable on scalability and/or runtimes? We propose Lotan, the first scalable and optimized data system for full-batch GNN training with \textit{decoupled scaling} that bridges the hitherto siloed worlds of graph analytics systems and DL systems. Lotan offers a series of technical innovations, including re-imagining GNN training as query plan-like dataflows, execution plan rewriting, optimized data movement between systems, a GNN-centric graph partitioning scheme, and the first known GNN model batching scheme. We prototyped Lotan on top of GraphX and PyTorch. An empirical evaluation using several real-world benchmark GNN workloads reveals a promising nuanced picture: Lotan significantly surpasses the scalability of state-of-the-art custom GNN systems, while often matching or being only slightly behind on time-to-accuracy metrics in some cases. We also show the impact of our system optimizations. Overall, our work shows that the GNN world can indeed benefit from building on top of scalable graph analytics engines. Lotan's new level of scalability can also empower new ML-oriented research on ever-larger graphs and GNNs.

{\bf Distributed Deep Learning on Data Systems (Cerebro-DS):}

Deep learning (DL) is growing in popularity for many data analytics applications, including among enterprises. Large business-critical datasets in such settings typically reside in RDBMSs or other data systems. The DB community has long aimed to bring machine learning (ML) to DBMS-resident data. Given past lessons from in-DBMS ML and recent advances in scalable DL systems, DBMS and cloud vendors are increasingly interested in adding more DL support for DB-resident data. In this paper, we show that there is no single ``best'' approach to achieve that goal, and an interesting tradeoff space of approaches exists. We explain four canonical approaches, compare them analytically on multiple criteria (e.g., runtime efficiency and ease of governance) and compare them empirically with large-scale DL workloads. Our experiments and analyses show that it is non-trivial to meet all practical desiderata well and there is a Pareto frontier; for instance, some approaches are 3x-6x faster but fare worse on governance and portability. Our results and insights can help DBMS and cloud vendors design better DL support for DB users. The system is based on top of Postgres, Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. \\

{\bf Resource-efficient Distributed Deep Learning Model Selection and Training System (Cerebro):}

Cerebro is a layered data platform for scalable deep learning. One of the biggest challenges for scalable deep learning is model selection, which is difficult and resource-heavy. This system provides high-level APIs for deep learning model selection and optimizes distributed deep learning training for model selection workloads. It adopts a new form of parallelism called Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP) and is the resource-optimal choice. It can expedite distributed deep learning training by 3x-10x compared to Horovod and TensorFlow Parameter Server. There are also subsequent works about bridging data systems (such as Apache Spark, Distributed databases, etc.) with distributed DL systems.\\

{\bf Video Querying System under Unbounded Vocabulary Setting (Panorama):}

Panorama is a video querying system for object detection and classification. It is designed to tackle life-long learning or bounded vocabulary issues. Computer-vision-based video analytics systems often require \textit{update} of the vocabulary as new classes/labels need to be added from time to time. Such updates involve re-training of the deep learning model, which requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Panorama is built to partially avoid and automate this process while expediting inference speed at the same time.\\
